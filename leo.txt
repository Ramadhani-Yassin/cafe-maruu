tip logic is to be traet as apercent multiplying the Cart Total  like how tax works but it must not exceed ten  percent when user even write a value above ten percent  it should not go on  allow contining [create order  just that on TIP make it behave that way and if its not filled it has to be zero percent multiplying cart total -- Cart Total   [maintain  all pre sets just fix the specific issue ]
